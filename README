Our aim is to build a lexicon containing information on semantic
features that can be therefore used
for the ambiguity
resolution. 
Our division into semantic classes is not fine-grained at all,
it does not go to such depth as for instance human beings classification like
in WordNet. It rather assigns minimum semantic features, like - animated,
abstract, concrete, interval.

The method we used in our work is supervised clustering. We take
a sample of words annotated with semantic features and on the
basis of learned contexts from a monolingual corpus
a programm will assign the semantic
features to the unknown words in the dictionary.
