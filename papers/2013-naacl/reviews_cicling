----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper presents two simple methods to improve statistical machine translation,
especially with regard to the proportion of unknown words in the text: morphological
analysis and stemming. It demonstrates considerable results in the translation
between morphologically rich languages: Russian and Czech, even though the overall
quality of translation is not improved sufficiently.

The paper is interesting and instructive as it shows that simple techniques may
help. However, the text needs to be read by the native speaker of English before
being re-submitted as the number of errors is unacceptably high.

----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper suggests using lemmatizer and stemmer to improve quality of statistical MT
when translating into a morphologically rich language (Czech). As far as I can see
the paper does not present new results: Lemmatization/Stemming reduces OOV, but
translation quality does not dramatically increase using BLEU. Many similar papers
exist, but the paper lacks most of the references to previous work. It also does not
explain how Czech word forms were regenerated from the lemmas and stems. There are
many typos and ommissions.

----------- REVIEW -----------
The work seems to be too preliminar. It consists on the application of well-known
techniques on a new corpus and/or language pair. The use of Moses' factored models
to incorporate the lemma (or stem) together with morphological tags is not novel.
Since Koehn and Hoang (2007) presented them, factored models have been widely used,
being the factors and decoding paths used in the paper one of the most usual ones.
The major novelty of the paper is the analisys of the problem of the
Out-Of_Vocabulary (OOV) words. But this analisys is too shallow.

The wording is confusing sometimes. It is not clear how the OOV words are
identified. In Section 3.1, the authors say that the words remaining in the source
alphabet (cyrillic vs latin) are the ones identified as OOV. But, later (Section
5.1), there are figures about the impact of OOV in languages written on the same
alphabet (English and Czech). Similarly, nowhere is said what system the figures
presented in Table 4 correspond to. First, as the example presented in the text is
in English, I thought that it is the English-Czech system. But later, comparing the
figures with Table 5, I realized that is the Russian-Czech system. That difference
is important taking into account the morphological differences between English and
Russian.

Besides, the evaluation should be extended. The evaluation shows that the number of
OOV is reduced, but there is not any clue about if those words are correctly
translated or not. As the author says, OOV words that remain untranslated extremely
harms the general perception of human evaluators. And translate them, even with an
worng word forms, can improve the human evaluation. But, as the author also says,
some of the OOV words (e.g Named Entities) does not have to be translated, and the
use of stemming can produce worse translations. Just the percentage of OOV words is
not enough to distinguish between them, and a more detailed evaluation (whether
automatic or manual) would be necessary. Similarly, the differences in BLEU are not
necesarily generated by a better translation of OOV words. In SMT the use of a
different translation model changes the whole translation, and although the quality
of the whole translation have to be checked. But a general improvement of BLEU does
no
t imply improvement on the studied phenomenon (OOV words).
