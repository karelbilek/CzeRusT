\section{Introduction}
Semantic category assignment or classification of words into semantic fields 
is exploited in development of ontologies or various NLP applications such as 
word sense disambiguation or question-answering.

In this paper we present our results in experiments with automatically asigning semantic features,
using logistic regression models.

The model is trained in a supervised manner
using a small training set of nouns that have semantic categories assigned. 
As features of machine learning \footnote{Initially, in this context of a Machine Learning the notion 'feature'
is used, but we will use 'atribute' instead so that it does not interfere with 'semantic feature' concept}.
we have chosen both morphological and syntactic properties of a noun.
The work has been carries out for Czech language.

Recently many tools for automatic semantic annotation have been created, like
clustering words into semantic classes(\cite{wordnet} - for English and other languages,
\cite{baroni:2009} - for German and Italian), semantic relation assignment \cite{peirsman}.

Our classification according to semantic features is not very fine-grained,
it does not go to such depth like that classification
in WordNet. We work with a minimum set of semantic features, like 'animated',
'abstract', 'concrete', 'interval' etc. 

\section{Data sources}
In order to build a model we made use of the following resources:
\begin{itemize}
 \item a Czech-Russian transducing dictionary where words are annotated with semantic features.
 \item monolingual web corpus of Czech texts, lemmatized - 405600 unique lemmas

\subsection{Dictionary with semantic features - Ruslan}
The creation of the dictionary \cite{oliva1989parser}
goes back to the 80's when the Rule-Based methods
in Machine Translation prevailed. Generally, the MT systems are constructed for
English and some other language. The choice of Czech and Russian as
a translation pair was partially motivated by a political situation, as

 The project was abandoned in 90's when
there was no need for the MT between Czech and Russian. There were
several attempts to exploit the data and the parts of the system, for
example, in \cite{mt-recycled} authors tried to use the module
of syntactic analysis for Czech for the Czech-English Machine Translation
and \cite{pisa2012} extracted the morphosyntactic information for
valency dictionary.
\subsection{The dictionary entry}
Dictionary entries in Ruslan contain morphological,
syntactic and semantic information.
The dictionary has about 5000 entries, 1080 of which are verbs.
Following is the example of an entry:\\
LE2KAR3==MZ(@(*H),!,MA0111,VRAC2).\\
LE2KAR3 - lékař - lemma, a doctor\\
==MZ - represents part of speech(noun) and declension class.\\
@(*H) - semantic feature 'animated'\\
MA0111,VRAC2 - declination class of Russian lemma + lemma itself\\
%KONZULTOVA==R(5,K,?(N(+(*H,*INS),-(*K,*A,*H),N),A(+(*A,*K),-(*H,*INS),A)
%,/,N(+(*A,*K),-(*H,*INS),N),I(+(*H,*INS),-(*K,*A),I),/,>
%S(I(+(*H,*INS,*Z),S(I)))),91,KONSULTIROVAT6).
We transformed the dictionary into a more readible plaintext format,
both human and machine readible, so that the data can be used in
the machine learning or as a human-readible lexicon:\\
(*A) dan nalog\\
(*C) datování datirovka\\
(*H,*K,*A) děd ded\\
(*A) defekt defekt\\
(*H) moucha mucha\\
(*N) pátek pjatnica\\
There are about 8000 lexical entries in the lexicon, we take 1800
translation equivalents that are nouns with assigned semantic features.
As the resource is quite obsolete(quite often expressions that are not used in Russian
anymore can be found) and the domain of the dictionary is restricted to old manuals
about the mainframe machines, only 2100 nouns
can be found in the modern monolingual corpus.
\subsubsection{Semantic features and how they work}
There are 16 semantic features in Ruslan, and each word can have more than one
feature assigned. In our work we will use only few of them - *H(animated), *A(abstract),
*K(concrete), *INS(institution), *INT(interval). Verbs are assigned by the arguments
which have restriction on nouns with definite semantic prperties. In example (1)
the subject of the verb 'to coordinate' can be 'human' or 'institution', whether
the object should have the semantic features either 'concrete' or 'abstract'. The sign (-)
before the set of features shows that those features are prohibited to used in this context.
(1)koordinovat(n(+(*h,*ins,*z,*os)),a(+(*a,*k),-(*h,*ins)),koordinirovat').

Following is the example of how they can influence the disambiguation process.\\
(2cz) Děda nemůže dojít do ordinace sám.\\
lit. Granny couldn't go to hospital on his own\\
(3cz) K této situaci nemůže dojít\\
lit. To this situation couldn't come\\
'Such a situation could not happen'

The ambiguous verb 'dojít' that has a literal sense of 'going somewhere'
and both metaphorical meaning 'to happen' can be translated properly
due to the semantic features assigned to its actants. In (2cz) the
agent has the semantic feature (*H) - animated, so the verb is translated
in its literal meaning(in Russian 'dojti'), whereas in (3cz) the actant does not have this feature
and it is translated as 'proizojti':\\
meaning (1cz) DOJD==R(5,NES,?(N(+(*H,*Z,*P,*F),K(D,DO(G)))),07,DOJTI).\\
meaning (2cz) DOJD==R(5,NES,?(K(D,N)),07,PROIZOJTI)\footnote{We should mention, that in this example
not only the semantics is taken into account, but also the surface realization of an argument}.\\


\subsubsection{Semantic features - negative experience}
As it was stated in \cite{KubonPHD2001} the semantic features did not
served the purpose of disambiguation, sometimes they introduced mistakes
so that translation process failed to produce a result at all. This
happened especially when a valency frame contained the prohibition
to use words with definite semantic features.
We will not use the prohibited features for our prposes, they will be rather "recommended" on the basis of
statistics. 


\subsection{Monolingual corpus}


\section{Machine Learning}
\input{machlearning}
This problem can be viewed as a feature assignment task or a 
classification task. %(this was a hint from Martin Holub)
When we assign a semntic feature to a noun, this produces a classification
of nouns into semantic fields.
