\chapter{Data}
In this chapter, I am describing both data, used for testing the systems, and training data used for training Moses and Treex(???) models.

\section{Testing data}
To compare several machine translation systems, we need some consistent data to show the deficiencies and/or improvements of different MT systems.

In general, we want to produce a system that's general enough and performs well on unseen sentences; for that reason, we should have -- in the case of statistical MT systems -- separated test set and training set.\footnote{As noted in for example \cite{koehn2010statistical}, p. 274, or \cite{bishop}, pg. 6}

We have tried to do that in experiments with systems that we control. However, the systems described in \ref{blackbox} are systems that we don't control. Especially with Google Translate, we cannot rule out the possibility that they already use some parts of the test data. The only way to absolutely prevent this would be to make our own test data, but we don't have enough resources to do that on a bigger scale.

In general, we use two test sets with two different domains - WMT data and Intercorp data.
