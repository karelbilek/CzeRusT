Goal: We want to build a model that will tag a noun with a semantic category.
The model is trained on a set of nouns from a Ruslan dictionary and a monolingual corpus.

Data:
monolingual corpus - PDT
Ruslan

Method:
The model is a supervised learning algorithm trained, in which the training data are:
1)input a word from Ruslan and a context from a monolingual corpus

making/generating more data with the help of morphology
take words from  Ruslan , 10% test data, learn the endings from a monolingual corpus
still only 40% of ruslan nouns are in PDT 



on the set of words+sem.tags from Ruslan







============old==========


The precision of assignment of a feature to a word varies from 40% to 50%.
The data are to sparse though, because there are only 2700 nouns in Ruslan.

We will combine this method with other linguistic staff, trying to add more data.
try to find some prpoductive model that will generate more words
with some definite semantic features, ex ucitel spisovatel, suffix (el) - *H,animated, 
specifikace, klasifikace - *Abstract, sekunda - *Interval.
Our assumption is that a word endling can characterize some class.



We use a PDT corpus, attributes will be context.
