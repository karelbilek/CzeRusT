We want to build a model that will classify Czech/Russian
substantives according to their semantic features.
The model was trained on a small set of nouns from  
a Ruslan dictionary.
The precision of assignment of a feature to a word varies from 40% to 50%.
The data are to sparse though, because there are only 1800 nouns in Ruslan.

We will combine this method with other linguistic staff, f.y.
try to find some prpoductive model that will generate more words
with some definite semantic features, ex ucitel spisovatel - *H,animated, 
specifikace, klasifikace - *Abstract

And use a CNK corpus, attributes will be context and morphology?.
