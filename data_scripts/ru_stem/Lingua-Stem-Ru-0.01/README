NAME
    Lingua::Stem::Ru - Porter's stemming algorithm for Russian

SYNOPSIS
        use Lingua::Stem::Ru;
        my $stems = Lingua::Stem::Ru::stem({ -words => $word_list_reference,
                                             -locale => 'ru',
                                             -exceptions => $exceptions_hash,
                                          });

        my $stem = Lingua::Stem::Ru::stem_word( $word );

DESCRIPTION
    This module applies the Porter Stemming Algorithm to its parameters,
    returning the stemmed words.

    The algorithm is implemented exactly (I hope :-) as described in:

        http://snowball.tartarus.org/russian/stemmer.html

    The code is carefully crafted to work in conjunction with the
    Lingua::Stem module by Benjamin Franz. This stemmer is also based on the
    work of Aldo Capini Lingua::Stem::It.

METHODS
    stem({ -words => \@words, -locale => 'ru', -exceptions => \%exceptions
    });
        Stems a list of passed words. Returns an anonymous list reference to
        the stemmed words.

        Example:

          my $stemmed_words = Lingua::Stem::Ru::stem({ -words => \@words,
                                                      -locale => 'ru',
                                                  -exceptions => \%exceptions,
                                  });

    stem_word( $word );
        Stems a single word and returns the stem directly.

        Example:

          my $stem = Lingua::Stem::Ru::stem_word( $word );

    stem_caching({ -level => 0|1|2 });
        Sets the level of stem caching.

        '0' means 'no caching'. This is the default level.

        '1' means 'cache per run'. This caches stemming results during a
        single call to 'stem'.

        '2' means 'cache indefinitely'. This caches stemming results until
        either the process exits or the 'clear_stem_cache' method is called.

    clear_stem_cache;
        Clears the cache of stemmed words

  EXPORT
    None by default.
